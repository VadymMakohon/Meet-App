# Version Support Policy

For the version support policy, you can adopt the following approach, which is inspired by Semantic Versioning:

## Version Support Policy
1. Major Versions (X.0.0): Supported for 1 year or until the next major version is released, whichever comes first.
2. Minor Versions (0.X.0): Supported for 6 months or until the next minor version is released, whichever comes first.
3. Patch Versions (0.0.X): Supported until the next patch version is released.
   
####This policy ensures that users receive security updates and bug fixes for a reasonable period, encouraging them to stay up-to-date with the latest releases.
